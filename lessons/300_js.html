{% section "JavaScript" %}
<p>Our site now supports JavaScript.
The code editor now has an indicator in the top right corner showing which language you are using: Python or JavaScript
You can change language by pressing corresponding button on the top panel.
Currently this feature is only present in problems and on some other pages including this one.</p>

<p>In your code you can use all features of JavaScript that you are used to, but for the sake of convenience we added two functions that you need to use to read input and write output.
They are called <code>input()</code> and <code>print</code>. They work as simplified variants of Python 3 functions.</p>

<p>Here is a little example. This program reads string from input and prints it with preceding "Simon says: ".
Try it out:</p>

{#<p></p>#}
{#<code></code>#}
{% program %}
// First, we create a variable and read string from input
var string = input(); //

// Then we print the concatination of "Simon says: " and our variable using + operator
print("Simon says: " + string);
{% inputdata %}
    jump
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

<p>Notice that even though semicolons in the end of expressions are not mandatory in JavaScript it is considered a good practice to use them anyway.</p>


<p>Javascript is actually very different from Python even though they are also similar in some ways.
Here are some coding examples that will help you to understand basic syntax that is needed to solve problems if you are not yet familiar with it.</p>

<p>First of all, let's rewrite our summing program which prints out the sum of three numbers from input.
Notice that we are using <code>parseInt</code> instead of <code>int</code> and that we use <code>var</code> when we first declare a variable:</p>

{% program %}
var a = parseInt(input());
var b = parseInt(input());
var c = parseInt(input());
print(a + b + c);
{% inputdata %}
    1
    3
    6
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

<p>The most awesome part of all this is that you can </p>

First, the function code should be placed in the beginning of the program (before the place where we want to use the function <code>factorial()</code>, to be precise). The first line <code>def factorial(n):</code> of this example is a description of our function; the word <i>factorial</i> is an identifier (the name of our function). Right after the identifier, there goes the list of parameters that our function receives (in parentheses). The list consists of comma-separated identifiers of the parameters; in our case, the list consists of one parameter <code>n</code>. At the end of the row, put a colon.\n\n<p>Then goes the function body. In Python, the body <u>must</u> be indented (by Tab or four spaces, as always). This function calculates the value of n! and stores it in the variable <code>res</code>. The last line of the function is <code>return res</code>, which exits the function and returns the value of the variable <code>res</code>. \n\n<p>The <code>return</code> statement can appear in any place of a function. Its execution exits the function and returns specified value to the place where the function was called. If the function does not return a value, the return statement won't actually return some value (though it still can be used). Some functions do not need to return values, and the return statement can be omitted for them.\n\n<p>We'd like to provide another example.

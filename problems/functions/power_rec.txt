Statement:
<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>Given a positive real number \( a \) and a non-negative integer \( n \). Calculate \( a^{n} \) without using loops, <code>**</code> operator or the built in function <code>math.pow()</code>. Instead, use recursion and the relation \( a^{n} = a \dot a^{n-1} \). Print the result.

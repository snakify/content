<p>In Python there is a function <code>ord()</code>, which returns its character code in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">the ASCII chart</a>, and the function <code>chr()</code>, which returns the character itself from the ASCII code. For example, <code>ord('a') == 97</code>, <code>chr(97) == 'a'</code>.

Name:
School desks

Statement:
One school decided to form three new groups and furnish the individual classrooms for each of them.
Each school desk is for two students. Given the number of students in each group, print the smallest possible
number of school desks that should be purchased.
<p>
The program should read three integers: the number of students in each of three groups, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> respectively.

<p>In the first test there are three groups. The first group has 20 students and thus needs 10 desks.
The second group has 21 students, so they can get by with no fewer than 11 desks. 11 desks is also enough
for the third group of 22 students. So we need 32 desks in total.

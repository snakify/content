Name:
Digital clock

Statement:
Given the integer N - the number of minutes that is passed since midnight - how many hours and minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock?
<p>
The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes
(between 0 and 59).
<p>
For example, if N = 150, then 150 minutes have passed since midnight - i.e. now is 2:30 am. So the
program should print <code>2 30</code>.
